# chess_ACPL_analysis_with_linear_regression
The file using_chess_engine_to_calculate_precision_of_chess_moves shows how to extract specific values and analyse chess games using R and chess engine.
The value I got from analyzing chess games is ACPL, that is average centipown lost. It's the value for expressing 
accuracy of chess moves in a particular game. 
File linear_regression_models shows usage of linear regression and many statistical tests  to examine determinants of ACPL.
